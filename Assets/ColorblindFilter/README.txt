Thank you for purchasing the asset. 

To take advantage of this asset, add the ColorblindFilter component to your main camera. 
To change the use of a filter, call SetUseFilter(bool useFilter). To change the type 
of colorblindness, call ChangeBlindType(BlindnessType blindType). All public methods 
are not static, access them through an instance of the ColorblindFilter class, which 
is a MonoBehaviour and must be on the camera.
